Structures
  Student records
  Employee database
  JSON-like data handling
  Classes replacement in C

Unions
  Embedded systems
  Memory‑critical applications
  Hardware registers
  Variant data representation

Note
  Structure stores multiple values using separate memory blocks.
  Union stores one value at a time using shared memory.
  Structure is safer, union is memory efficient.
  In C++, structure supports methods and access control
  Structures and unions are fundamental building blocks in C/C++.
  Structure → Data modeling
  Union → Memory optimization
  C++ structures are almost like classes (default public)
